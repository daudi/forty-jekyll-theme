Please let us know what you think about our tournament, what we got right, and how we could do better. Please see the various options for contacting us below: Twitter, Facebook, email, letter or you can use the form below. There's a lot involved in running a tournament and here are some major issues to consider:


* Did we manage parking effectively? 
* Did you like the food? 
* How well were the matches organised? 
* Were the trophies and medals OK?


Do also let us know about anything else that either pleased you (and we'll do more next year) or displeased you (so we can try to avoid or prevent it next year).

Thanks!
