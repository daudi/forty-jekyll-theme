Please enter the tournament by the main gate on Queen's Road. The entrance to Oakwood Park will be closed to traffic for the tournament. 

The map below (and above) shows you where there places to park. There will be parking attendants to help you, but it will be helpful if you familiarise yourself with the parking options.
